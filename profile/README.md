# Hi & Welcome to opensourcev2 on github

This is a project mainly done by me (Best) because sometimes things can be important then lost forever. I want to ensure things that may be lost forever are still available for you and myself. 

All information displayed within repositories on opensourcev2 we're publicly available (as in able to get) on any websites mentioned.

Feel free to open a [github discussion!](https://github.com/orgs/opensourcev2/discussions)

# Alternatively
Use the wayback machine
